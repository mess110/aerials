# Aerials

Crude 3d model of Poiana Bra»ôov.

How was this created you ask?

* first generate latitude and longitude between two points
* add elevation data from 3rd party
* convert (aproximate) everything to meters
* load it in coffee-engine

There are 3 scripts to help you

* generate_points_within_bounds.rb
* to_json.rb
* convert_to_meters.rb
